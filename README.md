# Welcome to EOSS

## Installation

To install EOSS click on `Clone or download -> Download ZIP`. This will download the zip file. Unpack the zip file into your root which should then contain `app`, `lib`, `temp`, `assets`, `tests`.

### For Linux

after you've unpacked your zip file do this commands:

```bash
cd into/your/root/directory
sudo chmod 777 -R ./*
```

And this is all you need to install the EOSS.
